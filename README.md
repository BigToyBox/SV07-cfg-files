# SV07-cfg-files

I wanted to try out a 3d printer shipped from the factory with Klipper installed so I ordered a Sovol SV07.

I run klipper on all of my other printers. I control them using my iphone and have no screens on the pritners. The SV07 was set up with some odd quirks that I wanted to change to suit what I am used to with Klipper. 

This is my first Klipperscreen. It's OK so far but the filament presets needed to be customized to my preferences.
