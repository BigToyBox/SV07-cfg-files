# Sovol SV07 Customization

### I wanted to try out a 3d printer shipped from the factory with Klipper installed so I ordered a Sovol SV07.

I run klipper on all of my other printers. I control them using my iphone and have no screens on the printers. The SV07 was set up with some odd quirks that I wanted to change to suit what I am used to with Klipper. 

This is my first Klipperscreen. It's OK so far but the filament presets needed to be customized to my preferences.

### *On day 1, I unplugged the filament runout sensor and tossed it in the drawer. 
(They cause too many false failuresd and I have NEVER had a filament break during a print)

I created a filament runout part that bolts to the factory spool mount using the two threaded holes at the base of the spool arm.
